# Authentication Setup

The VeCLI requires you to authenticate with Volcengine's AI services. On initial startup you'll need to configure **one** of the following authentication methods:

1.  **Login with Volcengine AK/SK:**
    - Use this option to authenticate through Volcengine's Access Key (AK) and Secret Key (SK).
    - This authentication method is suitable for scenarios where VeCLI is used in server environments or automated scripts.
    - Authentication information will be securely cached locally, eliminating the need for repeated configuration in subsequent uses.

    **Obtaining AK/SK:**
    1. Log in to [Volcengine Console](https://console.volcengine.com/)
    2. Navigate to "Access Control" â†’ "Access Keys" page
    3. Click "Create Access Key" button
    4. The system will generate a pair of AK/SK, please save them securely

    **Configuration Methods:**

    **Method 1: Environment Variable Configuration**
    ```bash
    export VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY="your_access_key_here"
    export VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key_here"
    ```

    **Method 2: Configuration File**
    Create a configuration file `~/.vecli/config.json` in the user's home directory:
    ```json
    {
      "auth": {
        "type": "volcengine",
        "access_key": "your_access_key_here",
        "secret_key": "your_secret_key_here",
        "region": "cn-beijing"
      }
    }
    ```

    **Method 3: Command Line Parameters**
    ```bash
    vecli --auth-type volcengine \
          --access-key your_access_key_here \
          --secret-key your_secret_key_here \
          --region cn-beijing
    ```

    **Verifying Configuration:**
    ```bash
    # Verify authentication status
    vecli auth status
